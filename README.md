# assignmentdown

This is a simple template for my usual statistics assignment customisations.

* Use `bookdown` for nice inline referencing of figures and tables.
* Style captions so that they are easy to distinguish from body text.
* Use A4 size paper.
* Add a TOC, but don't autonumber sections (avoids awkward constructions like "1. Question 1").
